    <h1>The Sisterlocks Package</h1>
		 <p>
            <em> Authorized Consultants offer Sisterlocks as a package of three visits including: A Consultation, the Locking Session and a Follow-up visit.</em>
        </p>
       
          <div class="d"><h2> First Visit: Consultation</h2>
		
			  <h3>During this session you and your consultant will discuss your personal hair care history, your styling perferences and your lifestyle in order to determine if Sisterlocks is right for you. You will also have "TEST LOCS" put in your hair to see if they will hold, check sizes, amount of scalp showing, settling in time, etc. This consulation in essential for both you and your consultant to ensure you get your Sisterlocks done in the most suitable way. </h3>
   </div> 
		
		
		<div class="c"><h2> Second Visit: The Locking Session </h2>
        <h3> Bring a good book because the locking process can take from 10-15 hours or even longer in some cases. The average Sisterlocks customer will leabe the session with an average of 450 locks and a whole new attitude! Your consultant will provide you with a "Starter Kit" that includes the proper shampoo for starting your locs, tiny rubber bands, and "tip sheets" in grooming ans shampooing as your locs settle-in. Be sure to schedule your follow-up visit before you leave. Good maintenance is the key to grogeous Sisterlocks over time. </h3></div>
		
		<div class="b"><h2> Third Visit: Follow Up</h2>
			<h3> You will need to schedule your follow-up visit after two shampooings, which is usually within a month from the time you first get your locks put in. Your consultant will monitor the integrity of your locs, tighten them up and give you an idea of how long the settling-in process is likekly to take. You can also begin discussing styling tips for the "total look" that's right for you.</h3></div>
		
	<div class="a"><h2>Ongoing Follow-up Visits</h2>
		<h3>
			We recommend that you scheudle your first few re-tightening visits at 4-6 week intervals. This way, the progress of your locs can be monitored. As your locs mature, your consultant will be able to determine how often you will need to come in for retightenings. The average time is between visits is 4-8 weels, depending on the hair type and rate of hair growth. </h3></div>
