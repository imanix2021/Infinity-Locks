	  <h1>The Sisterlocks Client Consultation</h1>

		<h3>
		<p> At the Sisterlocks consultation you can expect to spend approximately one hour. The consulation is designed to discuss the Sisterlocks hair locking process. You will be asked questions regarding your lifestyle as it relates to your past and current hair practices. This includes past hair styling habits, shampooing habits, daily activities such as exercise, outdoor pleasures, etc. We will discuss how the Sisterlocks process differs from other hair locking techniques. Your unique nautral hair texture affects the appearance of Sisterlocks</p>
		</h3>
	
		
	
		
		  
		<h3>
		<p> At the consultation, you will receive a cluster of sample locks, in groups of around 4-8. You should have at least 3"-4" of hair length. Less than 3" will make the sample locks difficult to analyze. The purpose of these samples is to determine your natural hair texture, any changes in texture and density and to choose which locking pattern is best suited for your particular hair type. We ask that your hair be clean, free of any oils or coniditioners and without braids or extentions. If you are transitioning from chemically processed hair to natural hair, at least 1 1/2" -2" of new growth is necessary. <strong>YOU DO NOT NEED TO CUT OFF YOUR RELAXED HAIR.</strong> If you have recently relaxed your hair or are between braiding appointments, you will need to reschuedule the consulation. If you have an extreme dandruff, eczema or psoriasis condition or unhealthy scalp, which requires treatment, please reschedule until the condition has improved. </p>

	<h3>
		<div> In order for Sisterlocks to be uniform in appearance and remain strong and healthy, we must form a partnership. The partnership means agreeing to be consistent with re-tightening appointments, following post appointment instructions and using recommended Sisterlocks products exclusiely.	</div>
